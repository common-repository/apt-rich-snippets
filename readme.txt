Add rich snippets and structured data to your Wordpress posts and get a higher click through rate on Google.

== Description ==

Rich snippets (microdata, microformats, RDFa & Data Highlighter) are the few lines which appear underneath every search result.  Add structured data in the form of star ratings, review info, music links and event info with this light-weight plugin to your posts, and Google will display your rich snippets when someone searches for a term that features your site.

Get a higher click through rate with attractive and informative rich snippets.**

= Easy Installation =

A few clicks and you are there.

= Customisation =

With customisation options, CSS editing features and convenient dropdown boxes - you are a few steps away from having rich snippets that fit the theme and styling of your site.

= Ongoing Development =

At present, the plugin offers rich snippets for reviews, music and events.  However, we are working on the development of this plugin to include all other forms of rich snippets. 


== Installation ==

Installation of this plugin is really easy.  You can edit the plugin's CSS output under the Settings tab.

1.  Upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory.
2.  Login to your Wordpress site (www.example.com/wp-admin).
3.  Go to the 'Plugins' page. 
4.  Find 'APT Rich Snippets' and hit 'activate'.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add Rich Snippets to my posts? =

When writing a new post, beneath the content box, you will see a 'Rich Snippets' dropdown box.  Click on it and select the microdata type that you are looking for.

= Why does this plugin only include options for Reviews, Music and Events? =

At present, the plugin has only been developed with Reviews, Music and Events in mind.  We are working on the further development of the plugin to include all types of rich snippets, but you'll need to give us a little time, as development is time consuming and expensive.
